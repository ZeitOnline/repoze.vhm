0.5 (2008-03-09)

  Brown bag release: I fudged the entry point for the xheaders filter.

0.4 (2008-03-09)

  Kill off path-segment-based filter (repoze.vhm.zope2).  Only the
  xheaders filter remains.

  Add license headers.

  The middleware now sets a 'repoze.vhm.virtual_host_base' which is
  preferred by setServerUrl over 'HTTP_HOST' when present.

  Add a getVirtualRoot API.

0.3

  Fix setServerURL method to take into account HTTP_HOST passed by
  client.

0.2

  Change repoze.vhm.zope2:setServerURL to allow Zope 2 to generate the
  correct request['URL'] value when the vhm is in the pipeline.

0.1

  Initial release.
